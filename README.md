### This Task is completed on forage platform as a virtual experience task

Task 1: To understand the stakeholders and the client Phone-now(telecome company) to built their stratergy to know their customers.
KPI's defined by the client were:

Based on above KPI's and by understanding the clients i created a dashboard in powerbi

Task 3: Create a Dashoboard for customer retention. had to create a dashboard/provide stratergies that will solve the buisness issues mentioned below:

 - Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
 - The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
 - Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
 - We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
 - We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
